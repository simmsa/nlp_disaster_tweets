        "## Project Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "This project explored the classification of disaster-related tweets using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) built with PyTorch. Various configurations, including embedding dimensions, tokenizer choices, and data cleaning levels, were systematically evaluated to tune hyperparameters optimally. The results demonstrated that a 2-layer embedding model achieved the highest overall performance, balancing validation accuracy (0.768221), precision (0.781197), recall (0.670088), and F1 score (0.721389) and a public Kaggle evaluation scores of 0.75973. The findings underscore the value of simplicity in model architecture, with more complex configurations yielding diminishing returns.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Lessons Learned\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Model Architecture and Complexity:**\n",
        "   Increasing embedding layers and introducing dropout led to marginal stability improvements but did not significantly enhance validation F1 scores. Simpler architectures performed comparably or better in most cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Tokenizer and Data Cleaning:**\n",
        "   The cased tokenizer demonstrated equivalent performance to the uncased version, justifying the retention of the original data's case sensitivity. Altering data levels disrupted tokenizer behavior without providing measurable benefits.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Layer Size:**\n",
        "   Models with fewer embedding layers converged faster and triggered the learning rate scheduler earlier, suggesting efficiency advantages in training. All models reached stability within 50 epochs, highlighting the importance of early stopping to reduce computational overhead.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n",
        "   The F1 score proved to be the most informative metric for this dataset, balancing precision and recall effectively. Relying solely on accuracy or public Kaggle scores would have overlooked critical trade-offs in model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Areas for Improvement / Future Work\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Feature Engineering:**\n",
        "   Incorporating additional features, such as sentiment analysis scores or tweet metadata, could enhance the models ability to capture nuanced patterns in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Architectural Changes:**\n",
        "   Future experiments could include transformer-based architectures, such as BERT or GPT, to assess whether advanced models outperform RNNs for this task.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Generalization Analysis:**\n",
        "   While this project focused on disaster-related tweets, extending the dataset to include non-disaster events could help test the model's generalization capabilities across broader text classification domains."
