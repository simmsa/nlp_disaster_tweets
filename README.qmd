This project develops a PyTorch [@pytorch] based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to classify
disaster-related tweets as part of the Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets Kaggle
competition [@kaggle_nlp], utilizing a labeled dataset of 10,000 tweets for binary classification
and submitting the model's predictions for evaluation.
